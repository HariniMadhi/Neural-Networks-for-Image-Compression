### Description
In this project, we investigated different types of neural networks on the image compression problem.
We divide the problem into two parts

### 1. Lossless Compression

We used a MLP based predictive coding for the lossless compression.
Details of the algorithm can be found in the [report](https://github.com/scelesticsiva/Neural-Networks-for-Image-Compression/blob/master/report.pdf)
The codes and instructions on how to run can be found in [MLP_lossless](https://github.com/scelesticsiva/Neural-Networks-for-Image-Compression/tree/master/MLP_lossless)
